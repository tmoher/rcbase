# Extract the path of the current directory.
# From now on you can refer to any file in the
# bot directory as: $BASEDIR/<my_file>
BASEDIR=$(dirname $0)

# Remember: nutella passes the `broker address`, the `app_id` and the `run_id`
# as command line parameters that you can access via $1, $2 and $3 respectively.

# Start your bot here with something like (example in ruby):
# node $BASEDIR/node-bot.js $1 $2 $3
node $BASEDIR/node-bot.js $1 $2 $3
