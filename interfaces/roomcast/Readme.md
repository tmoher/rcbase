The simplest possible nutella interface designed using web technologies

The interface already includes [nutella_lib.js](https://github.com/nutella-framework/nutella_lib.js) which will be configured by the framework automatically when the interface starts.

Remember: edit `<title>` to give a name to your interface and edit the `description` meta tag in `index.html` to provide a description of the interface.
